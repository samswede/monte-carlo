# Monte Carlo Exploration Repository

## About This Repository

Welcome to my Monte Carlo Exploration Repository! This repository serves as a platform for delving into the versatile world of Monte Carlo simulations across various domains, with a particular emphasis on chemical engineering, finance, and reinforcement learning. Monte Carlo methods are renowned for their effectiveness in handling complex systems, uncertainties, and probabilistic scenarios, making them ideal for a wide range of applications.

## Key Focus Areas

I'm exploring the intersection of the following areas.

### Chemical Engineering:

- **Process Optimization**: Analyzing how process variables influence chemical process efficiency and yield.
- **Economic Feasibility**: Evaluating the economic viability of chemical projects under uncertain market and cost conditions.

### Finance:

- **Risk Assessment**: Modeling financial risks and uncertainties in market prices, interest rates, and investment portfolios.
- **Option Pricing**: Applying Monte Carlo methods to price complex financial instruments.

### Reinforcement Learning:

- **Decision Making**: Exploring the use of Monte Carlo methods in policy evaluation and optimization for reinforcement learning.
